Java Interview Questions

1. Polymorphism

Ability of Single Method name to represent the Multiple methods in the different classed that are related by inheritance. It Allows methods to be defined in a superclass and overridden by Subclass.

Compile time Polymorphism: Method Overloading
This occurs where multiple methods in the same class with same name but different parameters.
It has same name but different Parameters
It doesnâ€™t require Inheritance since it occurs within Same class

Runtime Polymorphism: Method overriding:
This occurs when subclass provides a specific implementation of a method that is already present in its super class.
It should have same name, same parameter and Same Return type
It requires Inheritance

2. Interface
Interface is not a class,
Every method in interface is Public abstract method by default
Interface cannot be instantiated
Variable should be Final and static
It only implements the Methods to the Child Class
It's not has the variable access from the Parent

3. Abstract KeyWord
Cannot create object of Abstract Class
It's compulsory if the method is declared as Abstract then the class should be Abstract class
It is not compulsory that have abstract class only Abstrct methods
All the Abstract methodd should be implemented in its child class
here we are able to create object only with Concrete class
